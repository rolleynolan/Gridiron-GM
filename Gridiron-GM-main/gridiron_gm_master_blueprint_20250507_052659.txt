Scouting System – Final Philosophy-Driven Draft (Gridiron GM)
Core Concept
Every player’s full attribute set is visible from day one — but you’re not seeing their true values, you’re seeing estimates. The more you scout, the tighter and more accurate those estimates become.

No attribute is ever perfectly guaranteed. Even at “fully scouted,” accuracy still depends on scout quality.

1. Player Visibility
All prospects show:

Name, position, school, size, year

Estimated ratings for every attribute (e.g. Speed: 88–94)

Unscouted players have wide error bands (e.g. 65–90)

Combine invitees show real Combine numbers once the event is complete

2. Combine Results
Only Combine invitees participate

Their performance is based on their actual athletic ratings

e.g. a 93-Speed WR likely runs a 4.40

Combine results are public to all teams once complete

Pro Day performances are also based on true attributes but may be inflated (e.g., fast tracks, bad timing)

Important: Combine data does NOT tighten your scouting range automatically. But it helps the user infer where in the range the player might fall.

3. Scouting Mechanics (Updated: Staff-Driven Scouting)
Scout-Based Workload Model
Each team has a set of scouts, each with an Efficiency Rating and other future traits (e.g., position expertise, region strength, personality). These scouts are the backbone of all draft intel gathering.

Scout Efficiency Rating
Determines how many players or schools a scout can meaningfully evaluate per week.

Example:

Elite Scout: Can handle ~15 players per week

Average Scout: ~8–10 players

Poor Scout: ~4–6 players

Efficiency influences the number of ratings ranges tightened or players discovered per week.

Scouting Assignments
Each week, you assign scouts to one of the following tasks:

1. Region-Based Scouting
“Scout the top 50 players in the Southeast”

Scout will prioritize high-ranked players by projection, draft stock, or position

Efficiency determines how deep down the list they go

2. Position + Region
“Scout Offensive Tackles in the Midwest”

Efficiency determines how many players they can cover

3. School-Based Scouting
“Scout all draft-eligible players at Alabama”

Useful for powerhouse schools with stacked classes

Higher efficiency = deeper or more accurate coverage

4. Individual Player Scouting
Assign a scout to a specific player or short list

Prioritizes deep accuracy, especially useful late in the process

Scout Assignment Outcomes
At the end of each week:

Player ranges tighten (based on scout quality and depth)

New players may be discovered (sleepers or late risers)

Red flags or traits may surface

Scout reports are updated with notes ("dominates poor competition", "plays faster than 40 time")

Scouting UI Concept (for later)
Drag-and-drop interface or assignment dropdown:

Assign Scout A: “Scout QBs in Big Ten”

Assign Scout B: “Scout LSU”

Assign Scout C: “Scout Player #3147”

Each scout will return:

Number of players scouted

Updated scouting report accuracy

Notes or storylines (if applicable)

4. Interviews
Interview 10–20 players per cycle

Reveals:

Personality traits (“Film Junkie”, “High Ego”)

Off-field red flags

Mental makeup (IQ, leadership, competitiveness)

Higher scout quality = more truthful and detailed notes

5. GM Interpretation Bias
The user’s GM has a personality profile:

Film Junkie: trusts traits over numbers

Combine Obsessed: overweights 40 times

Risk Taker: ignores red flags

Safe Drafter: avoids unknowns

This affects how the game presents ratings, how media influence is interpreted, and how confident the GM is in their board.

6. Hidden Red Flags
Some issues only emerge with deep scouting or interviews:

Medical history

Locker room problems

Positional limitations (can’t play zone, poor run blocker)

Drive questions (e.g. “doesn’t love football”)

Media may also leak this information, or hide it.

7. Draft Board & Media Movement
Prospects move up/down dynamically based on:

Combine & Pro Day performance

Media hype or exposés

Team visits & rumored interviews

All-Star Game impact

Social media flare-ups (optional future feature)

Users must weigh hype vs substance when adjusting their board.


Injury & Recovery System Design – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Simulate a realistic and dynamic injury system that affects team strategy, player careers, depth chart decisions, and long-term planning. Injuries should carry risk, require management, and sometimes define a season.

Key Principles
Injuries can occur during games, training, or practice.

Different types of injuries (e.g. soft tissue, bone, concussion) with varying durations and recurrence risk.

Traits, fatigue, and staff impact injury chance and recovery.

Players don't always return at 100% immediately.

Injury history affects long-term health and scouting red flags.

1. Injury Occurrence Triggers
Injuries can happen in:

Game simulation (tied to fatigue, hit impact, weather, player traits)

Practice weeks (minor tweaks, season-ending freak injuries)

Training camp/preseason (wear and tear risk)

Rehab setbacks (only in rare cases)

The system considers:

Player durability rating

Current fatigue and morale

Injury-prone traits (e.g., Glass Cannon, Fragile Bones)

Environmental factors (cold weather, poor turf)

2. Injury Types
Each injury has:

Category: soft tissue, ligament, fracture, concussion, etc.

Body part: knee, shoulder, ankle, hand, etc.

Severity Level:

Minor (0–2 weeks)

Moderate (3–6 weeks)

Major (7+ weeks)

Season-ending

Career-threatening (rare)

Certain injury types affect performance even after return. For example:

Torn hamstring: reduced acceleration

Shoulder injury: reduced throw power

Concussion history: long-term risk factor

3. Recovery Timeline
Every injury includes:

Expected duration

Re-evaluation window

Risk of aggravation if rushed back too soon

Recovery curve: may return at 70–90% and ramp back up over 1–3 games

Recovery time is affected by:

Medical staff quality

Player work ethic / rehab traits

Facilities / stadium condition

Injury history

4. IR System and Game Day Availability
Players can be placed on:

Short-Term IR (eligible return in 4+ weeks)

Season-Ending IR

Teams must decide:

Rush back a starter at 85%?

Keep on IR and elevate a backup?

Weekly injury reports include:

"Questionable", "Doubtful", "Out", "Day-to-Day"

5. Long-Term Impact
Injuries can:

Lower long-term durability

Reduce physical attributes (Speed, Strength, Acceleration)

Appear as red flags in scouting future rookies

Force early retirements

Trigger contract clause disputes (future feature)

6. Trait and Staff Interactions
Player Traits
Iron Man: less likely to get injured

Glass Cannon: explosive athlete, but more injury-prone

Quick Healer: returns faster

Lingering Issue: suffers long-term effects

Staff Influence
Better medical/training staff reduce:

Injury chance

Recovery time

Long-term decline

Optional: some staff may push players to return too soon.

7. Game Engine Integration
During games:

Injury rolls are triggered per play, based on:

Player fatigue

Hit severity

Position wear (RBs take more hits)

Trait stacking

Injuries update the depth chart automatically, with team decisions required after game day.

Morale & Chemistry System Design – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Track the emotional and psychological state of players and teams. Morale influences individual performance, locker room stability, trade requests, and roster cohesion. Chemistry reflects how well a roster plays together — influenced by leadership, tenure, and winning culture.

Key Principles
Morale is tracked per player and updates weekly.

Chemistry is tracked per team and affects overall cohesion and in-game performance.

Systems are influenced by performance, management decisions, team success, and personal factors.

1. Morale (Individual Level)
Each player has a morale rating (0–100) affected by:

Morale Boosters
Big individual games

Team wins

Promotions in depth chart

Contract extensions

Praise in media

Mentorship or trusted coach

Morale Hitters
Losing streaks

Poor personal performance

Being benched or demoted

Trade rumors

Contract disputes

Off-field distractions

Clashing with teammates or coaches

Morale impacts:

In-game performance (especially focus-based ratings like Catching or Awareness)

Likelihood of holding out or requesting trade

Veteran leadership effectiveness (high-morale leaders elevate teammates)

2. Chemistry (Team Level)
Each team has a locker room chemistry rating, driven by:

Chemistry Boosters
Veteran leadership presence

Stable starting lineup

Long-tenured teammates

Consistent coaching staff

Team success and playoff contention

Chemistry Killers
Roster turnover

Poor leadership or cliques

Young/unbalanced rosters

Back-to-back losing seasons

Multiple trade demands or disputes

Chemistry affects:

Game-day cohesion (penalties, blown coverages)

Development rate (young players grow faster on high-chemistry teams)

Likelihood of locker room drama events

3. Morale Events and System Behavior
At specific triggers, players may generate:

Morale events ("Frustrated with usage", "Wants extension", "Tired of losing")

Player decisions (request trade, hold out, decline extension, retire early)

Locker room drama (affects multiple players, lowers chemistry)

Weekly morale updates factor in:

Player personality (emotional, stoic, diva)

Team state (contender, rebuilding, chaotic)

Media pressure and fan sentiment

4. Trait Interaction
Some players have traits that influence morale behavior:

High Ego: Quick to drop morale over slights

Natural Leader: Boosts nearby players

Loyal: Stays happy on one team

Mercenary: Morale tied to salary and usage

Hot-Headed: Prone to sudden morale swings or outbursts

5. Gameplay Impact
Morale and chemistry influence:

Player performance (mild modifers)

Trade value (morale affects demand)

Team performance under pressure

Player retention (contract interest)

Morale Impact Clarification
Morale influences performance slightly, not dramatically.

Think of it as a +/- 2% swing, not a +/- 20% swing.

A 99 OVR team with awful morale might:

Start sluggish

Commit more penalties

Lose a close game or two

Have locker room drama or player frustration

But they won’t collapse into a 3–14 disaster unless other systems (injuries, chemistry, etc.) also spiral.

Specific Mechanics:
Slight temporary reductions to mental/focus attributes:

Awareness, Catching, Play Recognition, Composure (if added)

Slight drop in development rate for low-morale players

Slight rise in in-game penalties for low-chemistry teams

Slight boost for high-morale players in key moments

These will accumulate for long-term team culture impact — but never override base team strength.

GM Personality System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Create varied and believable decision-making across CPU-controlled teams. GM personalities influence drafting, trading, free agency, contract philosophy, team building, and even risk-taking behavior. It also gives each CPU team a recognizable "identity."

1. GM Personality Profiles
Each GM is assigned a personality profile at hire. This profile affects:

Draft strategy

Trade behavior

Contract style

Cap management

Risk tolerance

Rebuild/retool timing

Scouting focus

2. Example GM Archetypes
These are foundational types — each GM may lean toward one or blend several traits.

The Aggressive Rebuilder
Quickly dumps aging talent

Stockpiles draft picks

Prioritizes high-potential youth over proven veterans

Will trade stars mid-season if record is poor

The Win-Now Tactician
Keeps veteran-heavy rosters intact

Pushes cap to the edge

Makes deadline trades to stay in playoff race

Short-term thinkers: mortgaging future for the present

The Value Hoarder
Only trades when they “win” on value charts

Lowball contract offers

Avoids risky signings or trades

Rarely overextends on draft board or free agency

The Analytics GM
Overweights combine stats and efficiency metrics

Ignores intangibles and locker room concerns

Loves late-round value and positional versatility

The Star Hunter
Wants big names

Signs splashy free agents

Aggressive at trade deadline or draft-day trades

Loves top-10 picks

3. Modifiable Personality Traits
Rather than fixed types, GMs are defined by trait sliders, which can shift over time or evolve across jobs.

Trait	Range	Examples
Draft Risk	Safe — Wild	Always takes 3-year starters vs. boom/bust freaks
Trade Frequency	Passive — Active	Never trades vs. weekly caller
Pick Preference	Late Round — Early Round	Loves late gems vs. wants top-10 only
Cap Management	Conservative — Aggressive	Avoids dead cap vs. restructures constantly
Scouting Style	Tape — Combine	Prioritizes interviews vs. loves 40 times
Player Loyalty	Emotional — Detached	Keeps veterans too long vs. ruthless churn

4. GM Personality Impacts
These traits affect:

Draft board construction

Who gets traded and when

Whether a team enters rebuild mode

Contract extension likelihood

Reaction to player holdouts or demands

How well a GM can identify player value

GMs with the same roster will behave differently.

5. Dynamic Personality System
GMs may:

Gain or lose traits based on team success

Adapt when hired by a new team

Develop reputations (e.g. “The QB Whisperer” or “The Cap Genius”)

Be replaced by owners based on mismatch of vision

Contract & Salary Cap System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Simulate a realistic NFL-style financial system that governs player contracts, team building, and long-term roster planning. The system should challenge the user to manage short-term competitiveness and long-term sustainability.

1. NFL-Style Cap Model
Hard salary cap with annual increase (with optional inflation toggle)

All contracts, bonuses, and salaries count against the cap

Teams must be cap-compliant during the offseason and regular season

Includes dead cap tracking from releases and trades

2. Contract Components
Each player contract includes:

Years
Typical range: 1–6 years

Rookies follow pre-set contract lengths based on draft slot

Base Salary
Paid yearly, increases/decreases over time

Signing Bonus
Paid upfront

Prorated over life of contract for cap purposes

Cap Hit
Calculated: Base Salary + Prorated Signing Bonus

Dead Cap
Amount of guaranteed/prorated money left after release

Affects future flexibility

3. Contract Types
Rookie Contracts: Slotted based on draft position (with offsets)

Veteran Extensions: Negotiated mid-contract, often cheaper

Free Agent Contracts: Market-driven, may include competition or bidding

Franchise Tag: 1-year fully guaranteed at top-5 salary for position

Restructures: Push cap hits into future (riskier flexibility tool)

4. Contract Negotiation System (Updated)
When negotiating, players factor in both objective market metrics and subjective recent performance, including:

Key Influences:
Overall and Age (baseline value)

Positional market rate (based on similar players)

Team success and culture

Recent individual performance:

All-Pro selections

Pro Bowl

Stat leader status

Near-record-setting seasons

Playoff dominance

Comeback seasons

Players with recent breakout years demand more than their base market suggests.

Example:

An 82 OVR WR with a typical value of $15M/year

Just posted 1,600 yards and 14 TDs, made All-Pro

Now asks for $20M+/year and more guaranteed money

This makes the system dynamic and reward-aware, and creates tension between:

Paying for what a player did

Or projecting their future

5. Free Agency
Multiple waves (early, mid, late)

Player interest factors:

Contract value

Depth chart opportunity

Team prestige or market

Fit with GM/coaches

Existing chemistry

Competing teams may need to:

Overpay

Offer more guaranteed money

Add player options

6. Cap Penalties & Rules
June 1st cuts can split dead cap into two years

Restructure abuse leads to long-term cap hell

Cap floor may be added to prevent tanking

Option to disable cap in sandbox mode

7. GM Strategy Impact
GM traits affect:

How much cap flexibility is maintained

Willingness to front-load or back-load deals

Willingness to tag players

How they handle aging stars vs. emerging talent

Trade Logic & Philosophy System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Create a smart, realistic trade system that reflects team goals, player value, contract situations, and GM behavior. Trades should feel authentic, rare but possible, and reflect contextual logic rather than raw ratings alone.

1. Core Trade Engine Behavior
Each team evaluates every trade through the lens of:

Team status: Contender, Rebuilder, Stuck, Rising

GM philosophy: Aggressive, Conservative, Star-chaser, Value-maximizer

Financial flexibility: Can they afford the player?

Positional need: Depth chart holes, injuries, age, expiring contracts

Asset value: What are they giving vs. getting?

2. Trade Value Calculation
All assets have trade value scores, updated dynamically:

Players:
Overall and potential

Age

Contract status (cheap rookie deal vs. massive veteran salary)

Traits and scheme fit

Morale / chemistry concerns

Recent performance (boosts value)

Picks:
Round + year (e.g., 2026 1st vs. 2025 3rd)

Discounted based on how far in the future they are

Each GM values picks differently:

Some hoard late-rounders

Others treat 1st-round picks like gold

Teams may overvalue their own players or picks, adding realism and friction.

3. Trade Types
Supported deal types:

Player for pick

Player for player

Multi-player + pick packages

Future picks allowed (up to 3 years out)

No cash considerations or “player to be named later” — stays realistic to NFL rules.

4. Buyer vs. Seller Logic (Final with Deadline Rush)
Trade Timeline & Frequency Behavior
Season Phase	Trade Activity Level	Description
Preseason	Low	Teams may move camp bodies or fill unexpected injury holes
Weeks 1–5	Low-Moderate	Smart teams start plugging roster holes or testing rebuild waters
Weeks 6–7	Moderate	More teams reassess identity: contender or not? Minor depth moves start
Week 8 (Deadline Week)	High	Trade volume spikes — known as Deadline Rush. Buyers become aggressive, sellers start fire sales, and surprise blockbusters can happen

This creates the narrative pacing of a real NFL season, where:

You can trade any week, but it’s rare early

GMs have internal logic that ramps up trade behavior gradually

Deadline week features:

Buyers calling sellers

Sellers actively shopping players

A sense of urgency: “last chance to fix our season”

5. GM-Specific Trade Behavior
Each GM’s personality affects:

Aggressiveness (frequency of trade attempts)

Patience (waits for perfect deal or acts early)

Pick vs. Player preference

Win-now vs. Future focus

Two GMs might view the same player completely differently based on scheme fit, need, or philosophy.

6. Trade Deadline Logic
CPU teams initiate trades during the final 2 weeks before deadline

Buyers contact sellers based on positional need and target lists

Offers may be accepted, countered, or ignored

Teams may also block rival trades for strategic reasons

7. Trade Evaluation for User Deals
When you propose a trade:

CPU checks:

Are we a buyer or seller?

Do we need this position?

Does this player fit our cap?

Do we like the contract?

What’s the return?

May counteroffer or reject entirely if it doesn’t meet internal value models

Fanbase Pressure & Market Influence System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Simulate how a team’s city, fanbase, and market pressure affect GM decisions, team finances, and public perception. Adds off-field tension, narrative stakes, and market-specific challenges to managing a franchise.

1. Fanbase Profile
Each team has a fanbase profile with the following variables:

Loyalty (0–10)
How forgiving and supportive the fans are over time

High loyalty = patient rebuild support

Low loyalty = quick backlash during losing seasons

Media Pressure (0–10)
How intense the local/national coverage is

High pressure = daily scrutiny, hot takes, leaked rumors

Low pressure = quiet markets, fewer distractions

Market Size (Small, Medium, Large)
Affects:

Team revenue and merchandise sales

National attention

Ability to lure free agents

Media narrative volume

2. Fan Expectations
Every season, the fanbase has contextual expectations, based on:

Recent team performance

Roster strength

Star player presence

Offseason moves

Owner goals

Examples:

“Make the playoffs or bust”

“Let the rookie QB develop”

“Beat our rival at least once”

Failing expectations drops approval, which can:

Lower morale

Trigger booing or public backlash

Affect coach or GM job security

Drop attendance and revenue

3. Attendance & Financial Impact
Fan happiness affects:

Attendance rates

Merchandise revenue

Concessions/stadium earnings

TV ratings if media system is expanded

Winning = packed stadiums
Losing + bad morale = empty seats, media noise

4. Dynamic Narrative Events
When pressure builds:

Media generates headlines

Fan petitions start (“Fire the Coach!”)

Players make public comments (“We’re tired of losing”)

Rumors appear in the news feed (trade rumors, locker tension)

GM must balance:

Making smart moves

Versus appeasing the fans/owner in the short term

5. Gameplay Impact
Fanbase pressure ties into:

Owner expectations and job security

Trade deadline urgency

Free agent decisions (do stars want to play here?)

Team branding and national relevance

Game Rules Engine – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Simulate realistic NFL game-day decision-making, including clock management, penalties, 4th down logic, and scoring strategy. Ensures CPU teams play believably and gives users control over rule toggles.

1. Game Situational Logic
4th Down Decision-Making
AI considers:

Field position

Time remaining

Score differential

Team strength (offense vs. defense)

Coach aggressiveness trait

Typical logic:

4th & short near midfield?: Aggressive teams may go for it

Trailing in 4Q?: More likely to take risks

Inside opponent’s 40?: May attempt long field goal, punt, or go

2-Point Conversion Logic
AI considers:

Score margin

Time left

Probability model (based on success rate of XP vs. 2PT)

Coach preference

Example:

Down 8 late in 4Q? AI may go for 2 to win

Up 1 with 30 seconds left? Kick XP to avoid risk

2. Penalties System
Each game includes a range of penalties:

False Start, Holding, Offside, Pass Interference, Personal Foul, Delay of Game

Penalties are influenced by:

Player discipline rating

Fatigue

Game pressure

Chemistry

Each team has a penalty tendency rating (based on coaching and roster discipline).

Stats are tracked:

Penalties per team

Yardage lost

Individual penalty leaders

3. Clock Management
CPU uses realistic end-of-half and end-of-game logic:

Spike ball to stop clock

Burn clock when ahead

Timeout usage optimized based on:

Time left

Field position

Remaining timeouts

Score gap

Poor-coaching teams may mismanage time more often.

4. Kick Decision Logic
AI decides to:

Punt, kick FG, or go for it

Based on kicker skill, weather, wind, game context

Also accounts for:

Indoor vs. outdoor stadiums

Recent kicker performance

5. Rule Toggles & Customization
User can adjust:

Overtime format

PI challenge rules

Number of challenges

Play clock duration

Penalty frequency

2-minute warning setting

These allow sandbox realism or custom leagues with unique rules.

Trait & Personality System (Expanded)
Each player and coach can have multiple traits that influence their behavior, development, and performance. Traits fall into several categories:

1. Development Traits
These affect how quickly or reliably a player improves.

Trait	Effect
Film Junkie	Gains experience faster, weekly training more effective
Practice Warrior	Dominates in camp, big camp/depth chart gains
Lazy	Rarely improves, even with playing time
Mentored	Learns faster with a specific veteran on roster
Coachable	Responds well to staff input, grows quickly with good coaches
Unfocused	Inconsistent week-to-week development
All Work, No Flash	Slow starter but steady growth over years
Confidence Driven	Breakout performances trigger growth spikes, slumps cause drops

2. Personality Traits
These affect contract negotiations, morale swings, and media interaction.

Trait	Effect
High Ego	Demands big contracts, gets upset if not featured
Team-First	Tolerates smaller roles or pay cuts
Quiet Leader	Boosts nearby morale slowly over time
Hot-Headed	Prone to morale drops or locker tension
Media Friendly	Boosts team’s brand value and attention
Mercenary	Follows the money in free agency
Loyal	More likely to re-sign with same team if respected

3. Durability & Injury Traits
Trait	Effect
Iron Man	Rarely injured, recovers fast
Fragile Bones	Prone to bone injuries, even with low contact
Quick Healer	Returns ahead of schedule from most injuries
Lingering Issue	Old injuries flare up over time
Play-Through-It	Performs while hurt, but risks aggravation
Glass Cannon	Explosive performance, but very high injury risk

4. Game Day Traits
Trait	Effect
Clutch Performer	Boost to awareness, accuracy, hands late in close games
Choker	Stat drop in 4th quarter of close games
Primetime Beast	Boosts performance in night games or playoffs
Slow Starter	Bad 1st quarter performance, improves as game goes on
Momentum Dependent	Plays better after a hot streak
High Motor	Higher chance to make effort plays (INTs, sacks, big tackles)

5. Coach Traits (Future-Ready)
Trait	Effect
QB Whisperer	Boosts QB development and performance consistency
Scheme Stubborn	Refuses to adapt scheme even if talent doesn’t fit
Player’s Coach	Boosts team morale and chemistry
Disciplinarian	Reduces penalties and locker room incidents
Developmental Guru	Boosts rookie development curve
Win-Now Mindset	Prefers veterans and short-term results

Individualized Development Curves
Every player follows a unique development arc, but it’s anchored to a base type:

Base Curve	Description
Early Bloomer	Fast OVR gain in college/rookie years, plateaus early
Late Bloomer	Minimal gains until age 25+, then surges
Steady Developer	Gains a little every year, long prime
Rollercoaster	Performance- and morale-driven growth/spikes
Flatline	Hits 1 plateau and stays there
Exploder	One huge growth year, then tapers
Bust Trajectory	Early promise, quick stagnation or regression

But within each arc...
Each player's curve includes individualized parameters:

Year-to-year growth chance (random + trait-influenced)

Attribute-specific growth (e.g. a WR might grow in Route Running but not Speed)

External event modifiers (breakout game, mentor presence, major injury)

Peak age and decline speed are randomized within the arc type

This means no two players progress the same way, even with identical OVRs or traits.

Trait & Development Arc Discovery System
1. Scouting Exposure
When viewing a draft prospect or young player, you never see everything immediately.

What’s visible early:
Basic physical data (height, weight, position)

Combine/pro day metrics (if attended)

Estimated overall and potential ranges

Trait hints (e.g., "Player shows great effort on tape" = High Motor?)

What scouting can reveal:
Development curve archetype (e.g., “Appears to be a late bloomer”)

Partial trait discovery (your scout suspects “Mentored” or “Film Junkie”)

Work ethic or coachability feedback

Trait accuracy improves as:

More weeks are spent scouting the player

Interviews are conducted

Your scout has relevant trait awareness

2. Gameplay Discovery
Once a player is on your roster or in the league:

Traits revealed gradually via performance:
Clutch Performer: Only becomes obvious after multiple late-game heroics

Practice Warrior: Dominates every camp battle, shows weekly growth

Hot-Headed: Gets in fights, commits dumb penalties, morale dips

Rollercoaster Arc: Jumps 6 OVR one year, then flatlines the next

Development arcs confirmed over time:
If a player explodes in Year 4, he’s likely a Late Bloomer

If he hits 84 OVR by Year 2 and stays there, he may have a Flatline arc

Traits like "Lazy" or "All Work, No Flash" show up as inconsistent or quiet growth, respectively

Media & News Feed Clues:
Headlines like:

“Film Junkie Rookie Impressing in Camp”

“Scouts Say WR May Be Peaking Early”

“Veteran Called ‘Uncoachable’ by Position Coach”

“QB Falls Apart in Another Primetime Game”

This creates a living narrative where you learn who players really are over years — not just by reading a stat sheet.

3. Trait Uncertainty Mechanic (Optional but Smart)
Players may have hidden traits or misleading scouting reports:

A player might be labeled “Lazy,” but your scout was wrong

A player might not show “Clutch Performer” until a critical moment

This encourages:

Observation over assumption

Development investment

Mentor-player pairing, hoping to uncover traits like “Mentored” or “Natural Leader”

Summary of Discovery Triggers
Trigger	What Can Be Learned
Scouting time	Traits, dev arc, red flags (with accuracy tied to scout skill)
Interviews	Work ethic, personality, mental traits
Game performance	Clutch, Choker, Confidence-Driven, Momentum traits
Practice/Camp	Practice Warrior, Lazy, Coachable
Mentorship pairings	Mentored, Loyalty, Quiet Leader
Media	Fan rumors, media leaks, coach comments — hint at hidden traits

Staff System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Introduce coaching, scouting, and medical staff as key contributors to team success. Each staff member has traits, strengths, weaknesses, and contract logic. Staff hiring, firing, and synergy shape player growth, injury management, and team identity.

1. Staff Types
Core Positions
Every team has:

Head Coach
Controls overall strategy, game plan tendencies, and team culture

Offensive Coordinator (OC)
Affects offensive scheme, playcalling logic, and positional development

Defensive Coordinator (DC)
Affects defensive system, pressure/aggression, and defensive development

Position Coaches (optional later)
Could specialize in specific groups (QB Coach, OL Coach, DB Coach)

Scouting Director
Coordinates regional scouts, affects scouting accuracy and player evaluation

Medical Staff Lead
Influences injury recovery, prevention, and treatment accuracy

2. Staff Attributes
Each staff member has ratings (0–100 or tiered) that affect game logic.

Attribute	Applies To	Function
Development Boost	HC, OC, DC, Pos Coaches	Affects attribute growth for players by position
Scheme Knowledge	HC, OC, DC	Boosts in-game performance for players in system
Discipline	HC	Lowers team penalties, helps morale
Leadership	HC	Improves team chemistry and stability
Scouting Eye	Scouting Dir, Scouts	Improves trait detection and estimate accuracy
Efficiency	Scouts	Determines how many players can be evaluated per week
Medical Skill	Medical Staff	Shortens injuries, reduces flare-up chance
Durability Training	Med Staff	Reduces injury risk from fatigue or practice

3. Staff Traits
Like players, staff have personality/functional traits that modify behavior:

Trait	Staff Type	Effect
QB Whisperer	HC, OC	Accelerates QB development
Win-Now Strategist	HC	Pushes for veteran usage, hates rebuilds
Scheme Stubborn	HC, Coord	Refuses to adapt to roster talent
Flexible Mind	Coord	Switches scheme to fit personnel
Risk Averse	Coord	Punts more, avoids blitzes
Player’s Coach	HC	Boosts morale, reduces chemistry loss during losses
Film Room Addict	Scout	Detects hidden traits faster
Inflator	Scout	Tends to overrate prospects
Conservative Diagnostician	Med Staff	Keeps players sidelined longer “just to be safe”

Expanded Staff Traits – Gridiron GM
Scout Traits
Trait	Effect
Combine Obsessed	Overvalues athleticism; may underrate productive players with poor measurables
Intangibles Guy	Gives higher grades to players with leadership or high IQ traits; may miss athletic red flags
Overprojects Potential	Inflates projected ceilings for raw players
Safe Evaluator	Undervalues boom/bust players, favors polished, high-floor prospects
Interrogator	Gains enhanced insights from player interviews; more likely to reveal hidden traits, red flags, or motivation issues early in the scouting process
School Bias	Overrates (or underrates) players from certain pipelines (e.g., SEC favoritism)
Tape Grinder	Values film over metrics; ignores bad Combine/pro day numbers
Checklist Scouter	Prioritizes players who meet prototype size/speed thresholds
Coach Traits (HC, OC, DC)
Trait	Effect
Over-Aggressive	Blitz-heavy defense, goes for 4th downs too often, causes blown leads
Ultra Conservative	Punts on 4th and 2, plays soft coverage, milks clock early
Scheme Zealot	Refuses to adapt scheme even if it doesn't fit the roster (e.g., insists on man coverage without fast corners)
Scheme Adapter	Will shift between systems based on roster strengths
Star Worshipper	Overuses star players regardless of game plan fit or fatigue
Development Guru	Boosts attribute growth across key positions (position-specific or system-wide)
Energy Manager	Manages reps well; reduces fatigue-based injury risk over the season
Discipline Expert	Reduces penalty rate, increases team focus under pressure
Medical Staff Traits
Trait	Effect
Aggressive Rehabber	Returns players sooner, but increases re-injury risk slightly
Conservative Diagnostician	Holds players out longer than necessary, lowers re-injury risk
Pain Management Expert	Allows players to play through minor injuries with less performance drop
Durability Builder	Reduces soft tissue injury rates during training and games
Recovery Maximizer	Accelerates post-injury stat recovery (e.g., regain lost Speed or Accel faster)

4. Hiring & Firing
Coaches and staff have contracts (years, salary).

Can be hired/fired, poached by other teams, or retire.

Every offseason includes:

Coaching carousel

Scouting staff turnover

Medical staff changes

Hiring decisions should consider:

Scheme fit

Player development pipeline

Rebuild vs. contention status

Cap cost vs. value

5. Staff Reputation
Over time, staff gain reputation tags:

"Top DC in the league"

"QB Developer"

"Overrated motivator"

"Injury-prone teams follow him"

These can affect:

Hiring interest

Staff poaching risk

Media narratives

Draft Board & Media Narrative System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Simulate the ever-shifting perception of draft prospects based on performance, media coverage, scouting rumors, and storyline momentum. Creates a dynamic draft atmosphere where players rise and fall — even without changing their actual skill.

Revised Draft Stock Tiers – Gridiron GM
Draft Stock Tier	Description
Top 5 Lock	Universally viewed as elite, near-certain top-5 selection
Early 1st Rounder	Strong Round 1 talent (picks 6–15), not quite generational
Mid 1st Rounder	Solid Round 1 projection (picks 16–22)
Late 1st Rounder	Fringe first-rounder, often scheme-specific or positional value pick
2nd–3rd Rounder	Day 2 prospect; strong upside but may lack polish or have red flags
Day 2/3 Fringe	On the bubble; could sneak into 3rd or fall to 5th
Day 3 Prospect	Likely Round 4–6 pick; often role players or athletic projects
Sleeper (Scouting-unlocked)	Projected Day 3/UDFA, but scouts/insiders believe in high hidden upside
High-Priority UDFA	Projected to go undrafted, but teams have eyes on them post-draft
Undrafted	Expected to go unselected; typically backup-level or developmental-only
Falling Star	Once highly regarded, but stock is dropping rapidly due to narrative or discovery
Buzzing Late Riser	Previously overlooked; media or scouting hype has rapidly raised their stock

How It Functions In-Game
Every player starts with an initial perceived stock level, randomly seeded and adjusted weekly.

Media and scouting findings shift perceived stock, not actual talent.

Teams and users must decide:

Trust the board?

Follow the media hype?

Or dig for that Sleeper label through great scouting?

2. Draft Board System
Each team builds its own draft board, influenced by:

Scouting quality

GM/scout preferences (physical traits, school bias, scheme fit)

Traits or red flags found

Combine performance

Boards differ across the league. A player may be:

#8 overall on one board

#65 on another

Boards update weekly as new information is gathered.

3. Media Narrative Engine
The league-wide media system creates storylines that influence perception, such as:

Narrative Type	Example
Combine Buzz	“QB1 runs a 4.41 — comparisons to Lamar heating up”
Work Ethic Concerns	“Scouts question WR’s love of football after early exit from bowl game”
Small School Spotlight	“D-III pass rusher dominates Shrine Game — real deal or one-week wonder?”
Injury Flag	“ACL report drops stock of All-American linebacker”
Off-Field Noise	“Star DB deletes all social media posts — attitude issue?”

These stories:

Affect CPU team draft boards

Appear in the news feed

May or may not reflect the truth

4. Dynamic Draft Movement
Prospects can:

Rise into Day 1 based on buzz, breakout games, Combine

Fall due to bad interviews, injury news, red flags

Rebound after Pro Day or media spin

This creates chaos and opportunity — true sleepers can fall, and overhyped busts can get drafted early.

5. User Draft Board Tools
Players can:

Create their own board manually

Tag players as "Targets" or "Avoid"

Sort by:

Scouted info

Narrative heat (media buzz)

Combine stats

Traits/position fit

Risk tier (Boom/Bust, Safe, Injured)

The user has to weigh stock momentum vs. true scouting insight.

✅ Draft Stock Assignment Logic – Gridiron GM
Perceived Draft Stock is based on true talent, but filtered through incomplete information and external influence. It’s not random — but it’s not perfect either.
1. Core Inputs for Initial Stock Placement
Factor	Weight	Description
True Overall + Potential	High	Raw talent anchors the base stock tier
College Production	High	Players with gaudy stats (especially in Power 5) may be overvalued
Conference Strength	Medium	SEC/Big Ten stars get more early hype; small school players start lower
Combine Status	Medium	Combine invitees gain visibility; non-invitees remain under radar
Position Value	Medium	QBs, pass rushers, OTs more likely to be overvalued
Age/Class	Low-Medium	True juniors and underclassmen are often viewed as more upside-driven
Injury History	Penalty	Drops starting perceived stock, even if talent is high
Media/Scout Biases	Randomized Layer	School pipelines, traits, or combine over/underrating may nudge stock up/down slightly

2. Example Outcomes
95 POT WR from LSU who posted 1,500 yards → Mid 1st Rounder to Top 5 Lock

88 POT QB from Montana State with huge stats but poor conference → Starts as Day 2/3 Fringe, becomes a Buzzing Late Riser

91 OVR CB with a broken leg → Perceived as 2nd–3rd Rounder, could fall despite top-end ability

82 OVR DE from Georgia with average stats but freak Combine → Seen as Early 1st Rounder

3. How Media, Combine & Scouting Shift Stock
Combine → boosts stock only if it confirms upside

Media → creates buzz spikes or red flags

User/CPU scouting → may unlock the “Sleeper” tier or reveal bust risk

Preseason & Camp Battle System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Simulate training camp and preseason competitions that determine depth charts, reveal surprises, and drive early development. Creates dynamic roster decisions and player momentum heading into the regular season.

1. Training Camp Phase
Takes place before preseason games begin. Designed to:

Track position battles

Apply player growth or decline

Trigger media buzz or internal coaching notes

Key Features:
Every position group has:

Incumbent favorites

Challengers or rookies

Staff evaluates weekly based on:

Work ethic

Morale

Development curve

Performance during drills (simulated under the hood)

Fatigue or injury

Outcomes:

Players may gain/lose attributes

Coach feedback: "Player X is earning first-team reps"

Breakout tags: “Training Camp Star” or “Struggling to Adjust”

2. Camp Battles
System tracks head-to-head competitions at key positions:

QB1, RB2, WR3, CB2, Kicker, etc.

Position battles are triggered automatically or manually assigned

Users receive weekly updates:

“Rookie WR closing in on WR2 spot”

“Veteran LT still ahead, but for how long?”

Battles are decided by:

Trait interactions (e.g., Practice Warrior)

Coaching staff preferences

Fatigue/injury

Preseason performance (see below)

3. Preseason Games
Simulated as a separate game layer:

Starters may play 1–2 series

Backups and bubble players play full quarters

Stat tracking matters more for bubble/development players

Outcomes:

Young players who dominate may get promoted

Injuries can open surprise roster spots

Media generates hype (“Undrafted RB makes noise”)

4. Roster Cut Logic
Preseason ends with:

Roster cutdown to 53

Team may:

Cut low performers

Promote surprise players

Stash players on practice squad (if implemented)

Keep injured players on short-term IR

Players at risk:

Low morale

Poor camp reports

Red flags uncovered during preseason

Bubble players may flash in Week 4 but still be cut based on total body of work.

5. Media & Morale Integration
Media covers biggest battles and surprise cuts

Locker room morale shifts:

Fan favorite cut = morale dip

Rookie surprise win = chemistry boost

Headlines like:

“Former 2nd-rounder released in shocking move”

“Coaches praise unheralded TE all camp”

Practice Squad & Injury Call-Up System – Gridiron GM
Purpose
Replicate real NFL depth management by giving teams a place to stash developmental players, elevate backups during injury crises, and promote standout performers. Adds long-term strategy and short-term flexibility.

1. Practice Squad Overview
Each team has a 16-player practice squad

Eligibility:

Young players (limit of NFL experience years)

Waived players who cleared waivers

Can include:

Developmental QBs

Late-round picks

Bubble players from camp/preseason

Players can:

Be promoted to the active roster

Be poached by other teams (must be signed to 53-man roster)

Develop slowly while on the squad (traits and dev curve matter)

2. Practice Squad Mechanics
Weekly evaluation simulates:

Progress in practice

Chemistry with staff

Trait-driven development (e.g., “Practice Warrior” grows faster)

Coaches may flag:

“RB X has earned a call-up”

“WR Y could be elevated next week if injuries persist”

3. Injury Call-Up Logic
When a player is injured:

CPU or user can:

Sign free agent

Elevate from practice squad

Move another player up depth chart

Emergency promotions may affect morale or chemistry depending on:

Fan reaction (“Why didn’t we sign a vet?”)

Player readiness (“Not ready for this role”)

GM/coach personality (some prefer next-man-up over outside help)

4. Waivers & Roster Risk
Cut players go through waivers for 1–2 days

Teams can:

Claim player (must add to 53)

Let player clear, then assign to practice squad

If another team poaches your PS player:

You receive a notification with their new team

You may feel the chemistry loss or depth hit

5. Development & Promotion Incentives
Practice squad players may:

Develop differently than active roster players (slower, but safer)

Be given in-game reps if elevated due to injuries

Become late-season surprises

Teams that invest in PS players may find long-term depth gems.
