Gridiron GM is a deep, highly-detailed American football management simulation, aiming for the most realistic GM experience ever made. All core logic is developed in Python, with future plans for a robust user interface (likely in Unity or Pygame for prototyping).

Current Development Status
Core Systems
Season Loop:

Fully functional. Simulates regular season, playoffs, crowns champion, saves league state.

Game Simulation:

Working for both regular season and playoffs. Simulates games and returns results.

Playoff Bracket Generation:

Fully operational; generates brackets and advances teams.

League/Team/Player Management:

Roster loading, team creation, and player assignments work as intended.

Standings Tracking:

Standings update throughout the season, with tiebreakers and playoff seeding.

Injury System:

Initial version implemented (future: more realism and edge-case testing).

Debugging/Testing
Heavy use of print statements and CLI outputs to verify logic.

System-wide simulation tested via run_full_season_cycle; no unhandled crashes in sim loop.

Recent bug: Game simulation returned None for playoff games—now fixed.

Project is stable when run headlessly.

Pygame window may freeze after a full season; focus remains on backend for now.

Development Philosophy / Workflow
Backend-First:
All features and logic are built/tested in Python with CLI outputs.

No Full UI Yet:
No resources spent on UI beyond necessary debugging/summary output.

Optional Debug Visualization:
Pygame used only for minimal visualization, if needed, not as a final UI.

Build One System at a Time:
Each major feature (injuries, contracts, finances, etc.) is developed and tested separately before integration.

Frequent Testing:
Simulate full seasons/years as new systems are integrated to ensure stability.

Next Planned Steps
Polish and expand current systems (e.g., tune injuries, add player development).

Add new features one by one (training, finances, scouting, player contracts, etc.).

Continue testing for edge cases and realism.

Only start working on a full graphical UI (Unity or advanced Pygame) after the backend simulation is robust and feature-complete.

How to Run/Develop
Run main Python simulation scripts from command line to verify logic.

Inspect CLI/debug outputs after each season for bugs, crashes, or oddities.

Use run_full_season_cycle() or similar functions to simulate seasons and review summaries.

If debugging is needed, add print statements or simple logs—avoid UI changes unless for visual debugging.

Contributing / Collaboration
Keep new development in modular files and testable functions/classes.

Document new systems with clear comments and update this README as systems reach stability.

Focus on simulation correctness and maintainability, not UI polish.

Long-Term Vision
Once all simulation logic is robust, start developing the full UI (Unity, or advanced Pygame prototype).

Continue adding advanced systems and polish for 1.0 release.
